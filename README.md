# 💫 Better LuaU
### A set of services and libraries to enhance LuaU as a game-programming language.

During my experience, I saw the lack of quite a few methods that could make the experience of use much better. Thus, I decided, in order to boost my projects, to create my own services and libraries.

At the moment, it counts with:

* Data structures
    * Stack
    * Queue
    * Set
    * Octree
* Services
    * HoverService
    * ShiftLockService
    * BetterSoundService
    * SerializationService
    * GizmosService
    * BetterChatService
    * SFXService
* Libraries
    * Quaternion
    * Math
    * Spring
    * AABB
    * Color
    * ObjectPooling
    * Signal
    * Maid
    * Promise

Even though most of them are not even finished yet, it is a good first approach to those methods.

Maybe, for most cases, they are innecessary, but I strongly believe that, within some time, this could be a game-changer for my personal projects.
